# ECoG RIC Benchmarking Pipeline

This repository contains code and example workflows for benchmarking Electrocorticography (ECoG) datasets using the **Recursive Informational Curvature (RIC)** framework. The pipeline includes preprocessing, feature extraction, visualization, and quantitative benchmarking tools for dynamic cortical projection mapping and decoding tasks.

## Features

- Automated data loading and preprocessing for open-access ECoG/EEG datasets  
- RIC feature extraction across single and multichannel signals  
- Generation of violin plots, UMAP/embedding plots, and cortical surface projections  
- Quantitative benchmarking (accuracy, AUC, ROC, clustering)  
- Support for multiple datasets and conditions (e.g., food-tracking, eyes open/closed)  
- Ready-to-publish composite figure generation scripts  

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place your ECoG/EEG data in the specified directory structure (see example scripts).
3. Follow the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for:
    - Data preprocessing and RIC extraction
    - Visualization (violin, UMAP, surface plots)
    - Statistical and machine learning benchmarking

For detailed instructions, see the comments in each script and refer to the example code.
